# Intelligent Dashboard

![Full Dashboard View](/imgs/img1.png)

## üìñ About The Project

This project is an **Intelligent Dashboard** created for data analysis studies. It's a web application built with Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly that allows users to upload their sales data in a CSV format and instantly visualize key business metrics and trends through interactive charts.

The main goal is to provide a hands-on example of how to build a simple, yet powerful, data visualization tool.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: CSV Column Name Limitation

This application is designed for study purposes and has a specific requirement for the column names in the uploaded CSV file. The script expects the following column names to be present:

*   `Product`
*   `Quantity`
*   `Total ($)`
*   `Payment Method`
*   `City`
*   `Sale Date`

If your CSV file uses different names for these columns, the application will fail to process the data and will display an error message.

!Error Message

**To fix this, you must ensure your CSV file's header matches these names exactly.** Future versions could include a feature to map columns dynamically, but for now, the names are fixed.
